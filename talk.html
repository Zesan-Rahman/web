<h3>1. Flat serve</h3>
<p>The flat serve is all about power. A good flat serve has a lot of speed, and flat serves do not have any spin on the ball. To do a flat serve, a continental grip is typically used. (insert grip explanations here). Flat serves are the simplest serves in tennis. You throw the ball above you, and then you hit the ball with the racket as the ball is descending.</p>
<h3>2.Slice Serve</h3>
<p>The slice serve uses the concept of spin. It is when the ball is hit and is spinning at a certain angle. To achieve this, the racket needs to brush against the right-hand side of the ball (or left-hand side if you are left handed). This spin makes the ball curve left, and then bounce off the ground to the left (opposite directions if server is a lefty). This type of serve can be used to catch your opponent off guard and if executed well enough, can lead to a very easy point. </p>
<h3>3.Kick Serve</h3>
<p>The kick serve is essentially the opposite of slice serves in terms of the angle the ball is sent at. Compared to the slice serve, in which the ball is sent in a certain direction when it lands, the kick serve sends the ball straight at the opponent. However, it is different from a flat serve because the ball bounces up at the opponent. This can be a great mix-up if you have been consistently doing slice serves or flat serves against your opponent. To do a kick serve, you need to throw the ball up and slightly to your left (assuming you're right handed). Then hit it with your racket without any spin. The video shown below is very helpful to learn how to kick serve.</p>
